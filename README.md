# Custom_Auth_User
This is A Custom Auth User for Django 1.11, plus some essential extras. 

This entails: 
        the Custom Auth User(models.py)
        the necessary modified forms(forms.py)
        the necessary modified Admin(admin.py).

Went through the Django Docs*, YouTube Tutorials** and Tutorials online*** to get what I think and feel are actually
the complete and most advised way of implementing a Custom Auth User Model. I bet you couldn't guess which one was
astonishingly and actually the most practical. Yes, you're right, the 'source code'. 

After trying and forever failing to thoroughly and completly understand it, it all became clear when I looked at 
the django's source code. I was so appreciative that it was open source in that moment. I only wish I could have
done it waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay sooner.

Take it from me, take a look at the source code every now and again, you'll develop an appreciation for its open
source-ie-ness, especially when you're having trouble.
