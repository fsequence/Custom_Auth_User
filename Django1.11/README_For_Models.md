After looking at the source code everything became much clearer but I still had questions. Questions that
I do not have the answers to. Like, does the django.contrib.auth.models file get loaded when something pertaining 
to it gets called, cause theres all kinds of stuff in their that My Custom User is gonna need. 

So I just included all the other code besides the default 'User' model. Lets just say that it would maybe
create a few extra tables in my database, so what. That would be better then not having the expected 
functionality of Custom User.
